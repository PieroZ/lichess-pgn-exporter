## üß∞ Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**  
  (check with `python --version` or `python3 --version`)

- Access to the tournament page on **ChessManager** (e.g., `https://www.chessmanager.com/pl-pl/tournaments/xxxxx/players`)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository or download the files

With Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PieroZ/lichess-pgn-exporter.git
cd lichess-pgn-exporter
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and activate a virtual environment

This isolates the project dependencies.

üíª Windows (PowerShell or CMD):
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

üêß Linux / macOS:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install required Python libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the .env file
The script uses a .env file to store configuration.
There is a template file .env.example in the repository. Copy it and fill in your values:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit .env with:
```
LICHESS_TOKEN=lip_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CHESSMANAGER_URL=https://www.chessmanager.com/pl-pl/tournaments/1234567890123456/players
```

üîê How to get your LICHESS_TOKEN

Log in to Lichess.org
Go to Personal API Tokens
Click "Create a new token", and copy the generated token without adding any additional permissions.
Paste it into .env.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script

After activating the virtual environment:
```
python main.py
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Output

The script fetches the list of players from ChessManager (Lichess nicknames column).

Then it downloads all games where both players are tournament participants.

Each game is saved in the pgns/ folder, for example:
```
pgns/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pieroz_vs_khahethel_gv82xF9.pgn
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kasparov_vs_karpov_Hyq7z9D2.pgn
```
